Hey peeps...
Navaneeth Prabha in the house!!!游때游때(let me clap for myself 游녪游녪游녪)
So I am a first year CSE student at Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, Kothamangalam ( in short MACE).

I like to do things apart from my studies.., like making new friends( which I like to do the most),play games, coding, watching movies and many more....
I forgot one important interest of mine, which I started during lockdown....posing for photo (like models游뱎游뱎游뱎)

One important thing to know about me is that I am very good at procrastination 游때游때 and I am a very talkative person (so feel free to contact me when you feel to talk游뱊游뱉
